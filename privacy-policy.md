# AIO Gap Analyzer Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 1.25.26

This Privacy Policy explains how the AIO Gap Analyzer Chrome Extension ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the extension.

## Information We Collect

- Google Search page content needed to detect and capture AI Overview text.
- The article URL you submit for analysis and the extracted text used to compare against AI Overviews.
- Analysis results generated by the backend API (stored locally in Chrome storage for your convenience).

## How We Use Information

- Run gap analysis between AI Overviews and your article content.
- Display results in the extension popup and side panel.
- Store analysis output locally so you can revisit results.

## Sharing and Third Parties

To perform analysis, the extension sends the AI Overview text and your article URL/content to a backend API you configure (for example, a Vercel deployment). That backend may call OpenAI APIs to generate analysis. We do not sell or rent your information.

## Data Storage

- Analysis data is stored locally in Chrome storage on your device.
- Backend services may temporarily process content to produce results. Please review your hosting provider and OpenAI policies for details.

## Security

We use HTTPS for network requests. No API keys are stored in the extension; they are stored server-side in your backend configuration.

## Your Choices

You can remove stored data at any time by clearing the extension's local storage or uninstalling the extension.

## Children's Privacy

The extension is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the effective date above.
